# Title:
To print "Hello World"

# Theory:
A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie.

# Algorithm: 
Algorithm does the following:-
1)Includes the iostream header, which provides input/output stream functionality.
2)Defines the main function, which is the entry point for the program.
3)Inside the main function, uses std::cout to output the "Hello, World!" message.
4)Ends the output with std::endl to add a newline after the message.
5)Returns 0 to indicate successful program completion.

# Explaination of the code:-
When we compile and run this code, the following happens:-
1)The compiler translates the source code into machine-readable instructions.
2)The main function is executed, and the text "Hello, World!" is sent to the standard output (cout).
3)The newline character is inserted to move the cursor to the next line.
4)The program returns 0 to indicate successful completion.
5)As a result, you'll see the output: Hello World
