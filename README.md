# Title:
To print "Hello World"

# Theory:
A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to a newbie.

# Algorithm: 
Algorithm does the following:-
1)Includes the iostream header, which provides input/output stream functionality.
2)Defines the main function, which is the entry point for the program.
3)Inside the main function, uses std::cout to output the "Hello, World!" message.
4)Ends the output with std::endl to add a newline after the message.
5)Returns 0 to indicate successful program completion.

# Explaination of the code:-
When we compile and run this code, the following happens:-
1)The compiler translates the source code into machine-readable instructions.
2)The main function is executed, and the text "Hello, World!" is sent to the standard output (cout).
3)The newline character is inserted to move the cursor to the next line.
4)The program returns 0 to indicate successful completion.
5)As a result, you'll see the output: Hello World

# Title: 
To print different types of data types

# Theory:
CPP has following data types:-
int,Integer,2 or 4; float,Floating-point,4; double,Double Floating-point,8; char,Character,1;wchar_t,Wide,Character	2; bool,Boolean,1; void,Empty,0.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm does the following:-
1)Includes the iostream header, which provides input/output stream functionality. 2)Defines the main function, which is the entry point for the program. 3)Inside the main function, uses std::cout to output the "Hello, World!" message. 4)Ends the output with std::endl to add a newline after the message. 5)Returns 0 to indicate successful program completion.

# Explanation of the code:-
Printing different types of data in C++ involves using the appropriate stream operators for each data type. 
Include the Header File: As before, this includes the iostream header to provide input and output stream functionality.
Define the Main Function:The main function is where the program starts execution.
Printing Integers:Use std::cout and the stream insertion operator (<<) to print integers.
Printing Floating-Point Numbers:Similarly, use std::cout and << to print floating-point numbers.
Printing Characters:For characters, use the same approach.
Printing Strings:To print strings, use std::string and std::cout.
Printing Boolean Values:To print boolean values, use std::boolalpha to print true or false.
Return Statement:Concludes the main function.
When this code is runned,the output displays different types of data.
